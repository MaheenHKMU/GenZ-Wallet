## 🧠 AI Interaction Overview

During the development of the **GenZ Wallet Landing Page**, I used **Qoder** (a generative AI design/code assistant) to ideate, design, and refine the page.  
Qoder’s role was primarily to:
- Brainstorm and structure the landing page’s content and layout
- Generate and optimize HTML/CSS/JS code for responsiveness and theme consistency
- Iterate on design improvements, bug fixes, and feature additions
- Ensure visual and thematic coherence across multiple pages (e.g., Dashboard, Calendar)

The AI acted as both a **creative collaborator** (helping shape the voice and marketing message) and a **technical assistant** (refining UI, fixing syntax errors, ensuring performance).

## 💬 Prompting Details

### **Prompt 1**
**Prompt:**  
> “Can you make a nice and cool design landing page for GenZ Wallet, tell them why they should use this tool and tell them all the function and benefits. I’m going to give you all the functions we have in GenZ Wallet (Smart Insight, Goal Tracking, Automated Expense Parsing, Learning & AI Reels, Gamified Motivation, Spending Caps, Community).”

**Summary of AI Response:**  
Qoder created a fully structured content layout with sections explaining *why Gen Z users should use the wallet*, *key features*, and *emotional impact*. It proposed an engaging tone with modern formatting, emojis, and relatable pain points (e.g., impulsive spending, lack of awareness).
